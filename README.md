# Detect Face Emotions Using CNN
Machine Learning project to get a better understanding of how CNN works.

During this project I got familiar with: 
- Training dataset.
- The need for adjusting the dataset and the layers used.
- The Convolutional\MaxPooling layers and how the data of the image is compiled in the finish process to form the output.

(*) Left the "train_model.py" file, but the data set to train is not attached (FER2013).
