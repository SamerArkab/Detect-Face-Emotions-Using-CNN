# Detect Face Emotions Using CNN
Machine Learning project - worked in a group of 3 members during the semester. 
 
While working on this project I got familiar with:
- Training datasets.
- The need for adjusting the dataset and how to do it, also about the layers used.
- The Convolutional \ MaxPooling layers and how the data of the image is compiled in the finish process to form the output.

** Need to revamp README
