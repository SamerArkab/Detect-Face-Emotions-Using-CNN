# Detect Face Emotions Using CNN
Fun Machine Learning project

During this project I got familiar with: 
- Training dataset (eventually used FER2013 dataset, due to lack of necessary hardware).
- The need for adjusting the dataset (size and color)
- The Convolutional\MaxPooling layers that the image "goes" through and how the data of the image is compiled in the finish process to form the output

(*) Left the "train_model" file, but no data set to train is attached.
